        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>This website is part of my assignment for the BTI325 course. The goal is to build a blog management system where users can register, log in, and post blogs under various categories. It demonstrates my skills in web development, including working with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and handling authentication with sessions.</p>
